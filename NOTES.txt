This document will log my thought process as I make this Renderer. 

8/3/23
	I am making the FramebuffersWrapper class and I felt the need to log the decisions I made today. I decided to make the Framebuffers a separate class.
	This was a blind decision by me but I decided to stick by it. I felt the need to log it somewhere so I can say I told you so to myself in the future
	if it turned out to be a stupid decision.

	I immediately went back against this decision.
